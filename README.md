📘 Prime Word Inspector

Prime Word Inspector is a simple and beginner-friendly Python mini project that analyzes text and provides useful statistics.
This project is designed for students and beginners who want to understand basic Python concepts in a practical way.
It works in the command line and uses simple logic to process user input text.

The main purpose of this project is to count and analyze words in a paragraph.
It helps users quickly know how many words, characters, and sentences are in their text.
This can be useful for assignments, writing practice, blogging, and content checking.

The program starts with a custom welcome screen and displays the current date and time.
It then shows a small menu with options to analyze text or exit the program.
When the user selects the analyze option, the program asks for a paragraph.

Step 1: The user enters a paragraph of text.
Step 2: The program removes punctuation marks using a custom cleaning function.
Step 3: The cleaned text is split into words.
Step 4: The total number of words is counted.
Step 5: Characters are counted with spaces included.
Step 6: Characters are counted again without spaces.
Step 7: The program counts sentences by checking '.', '!' and '?'.
Step 8: All results are displayed clearly on the screen.

After displaying the result, the program returns to the main menu.
The user can analyze new text multiple times.
The program only stops when the user selects the exit option.

This project demonstrates the use of functions, loops, conditionals, string handling, and basic text processing in Python.
It is a great mini project for school or beginner-level programming practice.
